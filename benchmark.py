Benchmark Script for LLM on OpenAI API Server

This script is a simple benchmarking tool to test the performance of the LLM model on an
OpenAI API server. It sends a prompt to the server and measures the time it takes to
generate a response. It also measures the number of tokens generated and the tokens per second.

Requirements:
    * pip install openai
